# My Weather Dash 

## Description

The weather dashboard was created from the open weather API to display the current dayâ€™s temperature, humidity, windspeed, UV index, and weather symbol. It should then display a 5 day forecast with date temperature, humidity and symbol. 

The searches are made by the user by city name in an input field and the search is saved. The searches are saved and displayed on screen after the user inputs a search and on page re-load. 
The users can select the searches in the history list to re display the searches for that city, current and future. 
When the UVindex is displayed it is shown with a colour representation of the severity of the exposure.

## Instalation

You can view the weather dashboard via this link to [Github pages](https://samwakelam.github.io/06_WEATHER_DASH_SLW/)

Or find the code on the [Repository](https://github.com/Samwakelam/06_WEATHER_DASH_SLW). 

## Usage

![Screenshot of the dashboard](assets/images/screenshot.png)

Search your chosen city from the input field in the aside. 

Your chosen city is displayed in the top article withthe current weather for that day, below is the 5 day forecast. 

Your chosen city will also be displayed in a list below the form as search history which can be called at another time. 

In addition improved usage that I have added:
* You can search in any case and the saved searches will display in sentence case. 

* There is a limit on saved searches. If you exceed this limit your oldest search is knocked off the search history list. 

* The search History is displayed most recent search at the top. 


## Improvements

I need to improve the responsiveness of the layout for smaller screens. 

I want to improve on the symbol graphics, they are a little basic. 

A really neat feature would be to change the background with the time of day or type of weather.
